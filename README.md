DevOps Cloud Engineering is the integration of development and operations 
practices into a unified approach to optimize the lifecycle of software 
development and deployment.
It focuses on leveraging cloud platforms like AWS, Google Cloud, or 
Azure to build scalable, automated environments that streamline the 
release process, enhance collaboration, and improve system reliability. 
Engineers in this field are skilled in containerization (using Docker or Kubernetes), 
Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools like Terraform or Ansible, and 
Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines, 
which allow for faster, more efficient development cycles. 
This approach ensures that code moves seamlessly from development to production, reducing downtime and enabling rapid iteration while maintaining a focus on security, monitoring, and cost efficiency.
